Campus Event Reporting System

This project is a simple event management and reporting prototype built for the Webknot Campus Drive assignment. It allows colleges to create events, students to register, and admins to track attendance and feedback. Reports can then be generated to see event popularity and student participation.

My Understanding:
The system mainly covers:
Event creation
Student registration
Attendance marking
Collecting feedback
Generating reports (event popularity, participation, top students)

Tech Stack:
Flask (Python) – for APIs
SQLite – for database
SQL Queries – for reports

How to Run:
Install dependencies: pip install flask
Initialize database: python seed.py
Run server: python app.py

Access reports in browser/Postman, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/reports/event-popularity

Limitations / Next Steps
No authentication added yet
UI not included (only backend + APIs)
Currently SQLite, can be migrated to MySQL/Postgres

Future scope: filters, dashboards, student app UI
